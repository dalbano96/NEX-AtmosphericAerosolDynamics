# NASA Earth Exchange - Atmospheric Aerosol Dynamics - NASA Ames Research Center
Data Analyst Intern at NEX, Summer 2018

The NASA Earth Exchange team enables several Earth science projects, including atmospheric aerosol dynamics. Particulate matter (PM) has a significant presence in air pollution, with PM being a major contribution to respiratory diseases. With the availability of atmospheric aerosol data from satellites, PM can be observed in remote locations lacking ground-based monitoring stations. However, the detection of PM from satellites requires calibration using ground-based aerosol data. The goal of this work is to use ground-based aerosol data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) to improve atmospheric aerosol mapping from satellite observations.
